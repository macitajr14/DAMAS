# DAMAS

Prototype of a classic Checkers (Damas) game. Features include:

- **Single player mode** against an AI with three difficulty levels.
- **Adaptive difficulty**: winning increases the AI level.
- **Points and rewards**: wins grant points that unlock cosmetic skins.
- **Match history**: tracks wins, losses and earned points.

Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or launch the simple graphical interface (requires Tk):

```bash
python gui.py
```

This project currently focuses on the offline experience. Online
multiplayer, matchmaking and cross-platform interfaces are planned for
future development.
